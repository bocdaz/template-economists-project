Templates for Reproducible Research Projects in Economics
===========================================================

This project aims to provide project templates for economists that make it easy to produce reproducible research using one or more of the most frequently used programming languages in economics (i.e Python, Stata, R, Matlab).

Users and curious visitors please take a look at the `documentation <https://econ-project-templates.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_. This repository is for developing the templates rather than using them.

Contributing
-------------

We welcome suggestions on anything: improving the documentation, bug reports, feature requests. Please open an `issue <https://github.com/hmgaudecker/econ-project-templates/issues>`__ in these cases.

If you want to work on a specific feature, we are more than happy to get you started! Please `get in touch briefly <https://www.wiwi.uni-bonn.de/gaudecker/personal_cv.html>`__, this is a small team so there is no need for a detailed formal process.
